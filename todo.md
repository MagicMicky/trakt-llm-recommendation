Missing:

* Profile analysis improvements
  => A single, flat profile risks oversimplifying a complex, dynamic person.
  🧠 The Problem with a "One-Size" Profile
    A single profile might:
    Over-prioritize dominant patterns (e.g., Sci-fi, drama)
    Ignore smaller, meaningful interests (like that occasional comedy binge)
    Fail to capture contextual preferences (you don’t want the same shows after work vs. on a rainy weekend
    Lead to "filter bubble" fatigue — always recommending the same kind of show

  => Taste Clusters / Personas
    Divide the watch history into clusters (e.g., via genre or tone), like:
    “Cerebral sci-fi fan”
    “Dark, gritty crime thrillers”
    “Light-hearted comfort comedies”
    “High-production epics”

    You’re essentially saying: this user contains multitudes. The LLM can then:
    Match recommendations to each cluster
    Or recommend shows that bridge between them (e.g., a dark comedy thriller)



* Recommendations improvements
  => Recommendation should also follow these clusters.
  => LLM prompt should support those clusters.

* History fetching:
  => Not all shows are there?


* Feedback loop - is the show already viewed? Or ensure it's being excluded.

* Candidate fetching:
  => Only trending? 

* tech:
  * Clean up same code being used for openai etc.
  * Clean up logging so that we don't log to the console the openai prompt, only to file





  Missing Elements to Enhance Recommendations
After reviewing your code, here are key enhancements that could make recommendations more meaningful without requiring additional user input:
1. Temporal Analysis of Watching Patterns
Binge Detection: Analyze how quickly users consume shows (binge vs. spread out)
Taste Evolution: Track how preferences change over time to identify emerging interests
Viewing Context: Detect what time of day/week certain content is consumed
2. Collaborative Filtering Component
Similar User Networks: Find Trakt users with comparable taste profiles
Cross-User Recommendations: Incorporate highly-rated shows from similar users
Community Trend Analysis: Identify shows gaining traction among users with similar taste clusters
3. Content Lifecycle Awareness
Currently Airing Tracking: Distinguish between completed shows and those with upcoming episodes
Season Positioning: Consider where shows are in their lifecycle (new season coming soon)
Content Freshness: Prioritize recommendations for shows that have recently added seasons
4. Enhanced Metadata Integration
Additional APIs: Supplement TMDB with data from other sources (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes)
Deeper Content Analysis: Incorporate data on show pacing, tone, complexity, and storytelling style
Critical Reception: Include professional review aggregation beyond user ratings
5. Recommendation Feedback Loop
Recommendation Tracking: Monitor which recommendations are actually watched
Implicit Feedback Analysis: Learn from user interactions with recommendations
Success Rate Optimization: Refine recommendation strategies based on adoption rates
6. Content Release Calendar Integration
Upcoming Release Awareness: Flag when new seasons of watched shows are coming
Preemptive Recommendations: Suggest shows to watch before related content releases
These enhancements could be implemented incrementally, with the feedback loop being perhaps the most impactful immediate addition to create a self-improving system.
